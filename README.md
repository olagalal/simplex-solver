[![Shields.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-college%20project-orange?style=flat)](http://shields.io/)

An implementation of the Simplex algorithm used to solve tableaus representing linear optimization problems. We even handled special cases, such as: Unbounded Solution, Infeasible Solution, and Multi-Optimal Solution. This project was made for (Operation Research - Second Year) in my college.
